# Documentation

The documentation here is still incomplete both in content and structre, so feel free to open
a [discussion](https://github.com/solid/community-server/discussions) about things you want to see added.
While we try to update this documentation together with updates in the code,
it is always possible we miss something,
so please report it if you find incorrect information or links that no longer work.

An introductory tutorial that gives a quick overview of the Solid and CSS basics can be found
[here](https://github.com/KNowledgeOnWebScale/solid-linked-data-workshops-hands-on-exercises/blob/main/css-tutorial.md).
This is a good way to get started with the server and its setup.

If you want to know what is new in the latest version,
you can check out the [release notes](https://github.com/solid/community-server/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
for a high level overview and information on how to migrate your configuration to the next version.
A list that includes all minor changes can be found in 
the [changelog](https://github.com/solid/community-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
